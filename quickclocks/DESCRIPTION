Description: A simple, unified interface for calculating 40+ epigenetic clocks from 
    DNA methylation data. Automatically detects input type (IDAT directory or beta 
    matrix) and array platform (MSA, EPIC+, EPIC, 450K, 27K). Integrates clocks from 
    SeSAMe, DunedinPACE, PC-Clocks, EpiMitClocks (epiTOC2), and methylCIPHER packages.
    Includes EpiDISH cell type deconvolution (RPC and CP methods) and smart thread 
    optimization based on data size and available RAM.
    Returns results as a clean data.frame with sample IDs and all clock values.
