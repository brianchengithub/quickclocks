Description: A simple, unified interface for calculating 40+ epigenetic clocks (and cell composition estimates) from DNA methylation data. Automatically detects input type (IDAT directory or beta matrix) and array platform (MSA, EPIC+, EPIC, 450K, 27K). Integrates clocks from SeSAMe, DunedinPACE, PC-Clocks, EpiMitClocks (epiTOC2), and methylCIPHER packages. Includes EpiDISH cell type deconvolution (RPC and CP methods) and smart thread 
optimization based on data size and available RAM. Returns results as a clean data.frame with sample IDs and all clock values.
